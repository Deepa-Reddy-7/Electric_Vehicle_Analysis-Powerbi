## **Electric Vehicle Analysis – Power BI**



##### **Project Overview**



This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyse electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in the United States. It highlights EV growth over time, vehicle type distribution, manufacturer performance, and state‑wise adoption patterns.



I built this project as part of my Data Analytics course to strengthen my skills in data visualization, DAX, and storytelling with data. Working with EV data gave me the opportunity to explore sustainability trends while practicing real‑world analytics.



##### **Dashboard Features**

* &nbsp;Analysis of total vehicles and average electric range  

* &nbsp;Comparison of BEV vs PHEV distribution  
* &nbsp;EV adoption trend by model year  
* &nbsp;Top EV manufacturers and models  
* &nbsp;State-wise EV distribution  
* &nbsp;Interactive filters for city, electric utility, and vehicle type  



##### **Key Insights**

* &nbsp;EV adoption accelerated significantly after 2018
* &nbsp;Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate the dataset
* &nbsp;Tesla leads manufacturers by a wide margin
* &nbsp;Adoption varies greatly across states, reflecting regional differences in incentives and infrastructure



##### **Tools \& Skills**

\- Power BI (dashboard design, interactive visuals)

\- Basic DAX (custom measures and calculations)

\- Data cleaning and structuring for visualization



##### **Dataset**

The dataset was provided during my Data Analytics course.

It includes manufacturer, model, model year, electric range, vehicle type (BEV/PHEV), CAFV eligibility, and state‑wise data.

(Not included in this repository due to file size limitations.)



##### **Learning Experience**

* Strengthened skills in Power BI and DAX for building interactive dashboards.
* Gained hands‑on experience in cleaning and structuring datasets for analysis.
* Learned how to translate raw data into meaningful insights and visual stories.
* Improved confidence in presenting analytical findings through clear visuals.
